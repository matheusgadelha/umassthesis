\section{Conclusion}
We presented a method to generate shapes represented as
sets of handles -- lightweight proxies that approximate the original
shape and are amenable to high-level tasks, like shape editing, parsing and animation.
Our approach leverages pre-defined sets of handles as supervision, either through annotated data or self-supervised methods. 
We proposed a versatile similarity metric for shape handles that can easily accommodate different types of handles, and a two-branch network architecture to generate handles with varying cardinality.
Experiments show that our model is capable of generating compact and accurate
shape approximations, outperforming previous work. We demonstrate our method in a variety of applications, including interactive shape editing, completion, and interpolation, leveraging the latent space learned by our model to guide these tasks.
