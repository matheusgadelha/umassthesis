  \textbf{Gallery of 3D shapes generated as sets of handles \emph{(zoom for details)}.}
  We propose a class of generative models for synthesizing sets of handles --
  lightweight proxies that can be easily utilized for high-level tasks such as shape editing, parsing, animation etc.
  Our model can generate sets with different cardinality and is flexible to work with various types of handles, such as sphere-mesh handles~\cite{spheremesh} (first and third figures) and 
  cuboids (middle figure).
