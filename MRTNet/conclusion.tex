\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we introduced multiresolution tree networks (\mrtnet) for point cloud processing. They are flexible and can be used for shape classification, generation, and inference tasks. Our key idea is to represent a shape as a set of locality-preserving 1D ordered list of points at multiple resolutions, allowing efficient 1D convolution and pooling operations. 
The representation improves information flow across scales, enabling the network to perform coarse-to-fine analysis, leading to faster convergence during training
and higher quality for shape generation. 

In future work, we would like to incorporate additional point attributes, such as normal and color, into the network, 
to further improve accuracy of shape recognition and allow the shape generator to produce these attributes. 
We would also like to apply 
and extend the method to process spatio-temporal shape analysis, such as on animated shapes or other temporarlly changing 3D point data.
