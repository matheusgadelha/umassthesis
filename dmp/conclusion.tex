\section{Conclusion}

We presented a manifold prior induced by deep neural networks.
Our experiments show that the prior can be effectively used for a variety of manifold reconstruction
tasks: denoising, interpolation and single-view reconstruction.
Besides, we analyzed the influence of the architecture in the characteristics of the prior
by posing the models as GP.
In conjunction to the prior induced by deep networks, we showed that using a stretch regularization procedure enables
better manifold approximation and improves the quality of the generated meshes, reducing large deformations and overlaps
between different parameterizations.
