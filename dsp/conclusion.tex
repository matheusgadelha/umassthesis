\section{Conclusion}

We showed that by combining the deep image or volumetric prior with differentiable projection operators, signals can be reconstructed from a few noisy projection measurements using stochastic gradient descent.
The approach is learning free and can be used as a generic prior.
Nevertheless, with a relatively simple network architecture our approach outperformed several handcrafted and procedural priors for image based and volumetric reconstruction tasks.
Although we presented results for tomography and for shape reconstruction from silhouettes and depth maps, the approach can be used whenever the rendering or measurement process is differentiable.
These include problems such as estimating shape from shading and geometry from multiple shaded images.

A potential issue is the use of volumetric representations for shapes which
incurs high memory requirements and longer running times.
A possible line of research is to investigate shape priors for
more compact 3D representations like point clouds or multi-view.
Combining deep priors with work on differentiable computer graphics
pipelines opens up the possibility of applying this approach for
solving inverse problems in many applications.
